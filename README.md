## NURBS - Non Uniform Rational B-Splines.

This python module is a revival and update of Runar Tenfjord's NURBS toolbox, which itself
is a port of Mark Spink's SCILAB/MATLAB tolbox to python with help of numpy.

#### Dependency
Python 2.0 or above  
NumPy  
PyOpenGL -> optional  

#### Installation
Just run  ```python setup.py install```  

#### License
Runar Tenfjord originally relased this package under the GPL Version 2 license,   
so I suppose that means it has to stay that way.   

Originally by: Runar Tenfjord, runten@netcom.no  
Minor updates to work with NumPy by Alex Wiltschko
